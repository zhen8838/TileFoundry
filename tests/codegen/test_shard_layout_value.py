"""Render a sharded operand's ``ShardLayout`` value for a sliced mesh.

A slice lives in the IR as ``ComposedLayout(inner, offset, outer)``, and the
emitted C++ has to carry both halves: the sub-box the mesh covers and where in
the launch level it starts. The type renderer already did; these pin the value
renderer to the same answer, since the runtime reads the offset back off the
mesh to turn a program id into a mesh coordinate.

See [runtime §2.3](docs/spec/runtime.md#23-tilefoundrymesh).
