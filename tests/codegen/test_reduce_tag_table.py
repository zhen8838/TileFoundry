"""The reduce tag table and the Partial attr both name a ``ReduceKind``.

Two guards over the same mapping. ``REDUCE_TAG`` was missing ``MAX`` until a
call site raised ``KeyError`` at emission time, and ``_render_attr`` answered
``shard::P<void>`` for every ``Partial``, so a partial's reduction never
reached C++ at all. Both are one table now, and these pin it.

See [runtime §3.2](docs/spec/runtime.md#32-tilefoundryopsreduce-reduction-family).
