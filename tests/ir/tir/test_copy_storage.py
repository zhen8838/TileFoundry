"""``ops::copy`` across the storage boundaries and both vector widths, one kernel.

``copy`` names no tier: it resolves both operands to this instance's slice and
hands the pair to ``cute::copy``. What differs between the crossings is what
``to_local`` hands over -- a projected gmem window, a shared allocation the
whole block owns, or a thread's own registers -- and each of those used to be
got wrong differently. The width falls out of the same shapes, so it rides the
same kernel: five operand pairs, one module, one compile.
