"""Building a decode oracle out of a Hugging Face model, without its cache.

Every model in the corpus states the same decode contract: one token per step,
the active context length as the only dimension left as a range, and the KV cache
passed as explicit tensors in and out. The reference for that contract is
constructed the same way every time, and the construction is the part worth
stating once -- it is a claim about Hugging Face, not about any one model.

Two facts hold it up, both measured rather than assumed:

- A layer run over the whole sequence under a causal mask, with the last position
  kept, equals a cached one-token step. Causality makes that position's output
  depend on exactly the context before it, so the equality is structural and not
  a coincidence of dimensions.
- Keys and values built by running the layer's own norm, projections and rotary
  embedding over the context are what its cache would have held. Not
  approximately: the same tensors, through the same modules, in the same order.

Together they mean no ``Cache`` object is constructed on either side. That matters
because the kernels under test own their cache explicitly; a reference that
borrowed Hugging Face's caching would be checking one cache implementation
against another rather than checking the computation.

What is *not* here is how one attention module turns normed hidden states into a
key and a value. That genuinely differs -- Qwen3 normalises per head and Qwen2
does not, Qwen2 carries projection biases and Qwen3 does not -- so each model
states its own, and passes it in.
