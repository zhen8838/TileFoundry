"""This model's corpus entry: what is selected from it, and how it is judged.

One case, one model, one root. The three kernels are separate execution domains --
an HIR Function may only call a Function its own Module owns -- so each is its own
child Module, and a case names them by the path it reached them through rather
than by naming three models.

The `reference` is spent on KDA, which is BLOCKED. That is deliberate: of the three
kernels it is the one that distinguishes this model, and a capability matrix that
recorded only the two with oracles would report this model as covered. MLA (both
forms) and the MoE are measured in `test_mla.py` and `test_moe.py`, at f32
round-off, each with perturbation tests establishing that those comparisons can
fail.

Schedule admits one function per execution Module, so it selects each child's
entry and not its leaves; analyze selects everything the tree defines. What is not
selected is untested, and the report derives that from the model's own function
inventory.
