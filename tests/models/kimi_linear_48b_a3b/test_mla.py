"""Kimi-Linear MLA decode step vs Hugging Face, in both of its forms.

On the host, because this submodule is small enough not to need a device. Both
sides run at the dtype the checkpoint publishes.

Every number this file asserts was measured before it was written down. The
parity tests are only half the point: the perturbation tests below establish that
the parity tests can *fail*, which is what makes them evidence. Without them a
kernel that ignored the cache, or used the wrong scaling, would pass a config
check and read as correct.
