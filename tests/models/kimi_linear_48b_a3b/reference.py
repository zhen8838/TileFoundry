"""The executable semantics Kimi-Linear-48B-A3B's submodules are held to.

Inputs and oracle are one pair on purpose: the oracle is a Hugging Face module
with random weights, so a factory returning only tensors would leave a test free
to score them against a differently initialised module. What each `*_inputs`
returns therefore carries both the evaluator's arguments and the module they were
drawn from. Everything is seeded, so a disagreement is a disagreement about the
compiler rather than about which random draw each side got.

Two of the three submodules have a real oracle. One does not, and that is the
honest headline for this model -- see `KDA_BLOCK_REASON`.

#:
#: The nearest installed relative is `Qwen3NextGatedDeltaNet`, and it computes a
#: different function: its forget gate is one scalar per head
#: (`g_t = g[:, :, i]`, so the state decays uniformly), while KDA's is a 128-wide
#: vector per head applied column-wise. Substituting it would score KDA against
#: a model that is not KDA.

#: covers KDA's gate placement and normalisation order.
