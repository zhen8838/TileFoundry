"""Gemma-2-2B's entry in the model corpus.

Lives beside the model rather than in ``registry.py`` so the description and the
description's subject move together: the functions selected here are the
functions ``model.py`` defines, and a kernel renamed in one file
without the other is a mismatch inside one package rather than a broken import
across two.

Analyse selects every function the model defines -- what is not selected here is
untested, and the report derives that from the model's own function inventory.
Schedule admits only the module entry function, because the device-wide partition
algorithm decides the launch and a leaf is not something it has an answer to.
``sized`` is a third question: whether the model can be analysed at a context
length of the caller's choosing.

Every case below is declared as passing, and two of the analyse cases, the
schedule case and the sized case do not pass yet -- not for a reason in this
package. ``Gelu`` has an evaluation handler and no *cost* evaluator, so anything
that costs ``mlp`` or ``decoder_layer`` stops at
``no cost evaluator registered for Gelu``: all four analysis families, the
partition, and the sized question alike. It is one registration next to
``Sigmoid`` / ``Softplus`` / ``Tanh`` / ``ReLU`` in
``src/tilefoundry/visitor_registry/op_cost.py`` (``_elementwise``, as those are),
and it is deliberately not made here -- this package's boundary is
``tests/models/gemma2_2b/``.

They are not recorded as ``BLOCKED`` because a gate could not carry the claim
honestly: the analyse and sized gates would absorb it, but ``schedule`` fails
with ``PartitionProblemError`` -- a ``ValueError``, not a ``ScheduleError`` --
which ``CapabilityGate.expected_failure`` cannot express, and the schedule case
cannot be dropped either (the harness requires each model to select its module
entry). Half a matrix of blocks around one missing registration would describe a
limit of this model, which this is not.
