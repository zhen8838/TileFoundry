"""A tiled MLP against a naive one: the loop nest reassociates, and nothing else.

Test-only, and deliberately not a model. The two functions below are the same
arithmetic written twice -- once as three plain matmuls, once as the blocked
K-walk a register-file-shaped backend wants -- so what a disagreement between
them can mean is narrowed to the rewrite itself. There is no checkpoint here, no
Hugging Face oracle, no corpus or catalog entry: a published model states what
the model computes, and an optimisation states that a rewrite preserves it.
Those are different claims, and keeping the tiled form out of the shipped
fixtures is what stops the second from being read as the first.

The dimensions are this file's own, chosen only so the blocking divides: they are
not any checkpoint's, and nothing here should be read as a statement about one.
