"""The executable semantics one MiniCPM3-4B decode step is held to.

One step is drawn at a stated context length: the context's hidden states are
drawn, the KV cache is built from them, and the token being decoded is the one
that follows. The cache is passed as plain tensors and the oracle is taken from a
full-sequence forward's last position, so neither side constructs a Hugging Face
cache object. `tests/models/dense_decode.py` owns that drawing, and everything
below states what makes this model's oracle its own.

The Hugging Face side is built from `model.published()` -- the checkpoint's own
`config.json`, through `MiniCPM3Config` -- so the oracle and the kernels are the
same model by construction rather than by two hand-copied dimension lists
agreeing.

Everything is seeded, so a disagreement is a disagreement about the compiler
rather than about which random draw each side happened to get.

`residual_scale` is read off the HF layer rather than derived: it is a value the
step is given, not a weight it holds, so it travels after the weights.
