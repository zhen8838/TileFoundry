"""DeepSeek-V4-Flash as one corpus case: what runs, what is analysed, what is
scheduled, and at what context length.

The boundary this model states is the sliding-window MLA attention submodule of
its first sliding layer, named as that -- ``DeepseekV4ForCausalLM.layer0.attention``,
the layer's own copy rather than the component it was built from, so what the
corpus reports is a Module the published model really holds. The tree above it --
embedding, 43 decoder layers, MoE, final norm, head -- is a real end-to-end path
with a real checkpoint pipeline behind it (`test_causal_lm_e2e.py`), and it is a
tree of Modules walked by orchestration methods rather than a Module of Functions:
a `ModelCase` names one Module and analysis and scheduling select Functions of
that one Module, so naming the root would put every kernel that does arithmetic
out of reach and report the model as three norms and an add.

`ctx_len` is bounded by the window rather than by the position embedding, so the
lengths here are small: a query in a sliding layer attends `window` positions
counting its own, and asking this description about the corpus's usual 1024 is
rejected outright rather than answered -- the envelope is `[1, 128)`, and a
context this layer type cannot attend has no cost profile worth reporting.
