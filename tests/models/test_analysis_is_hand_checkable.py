"""What the analyses say about a real decoder layer, checked against arithmetic.

Every other test of these families asks whether they run. That is a different
question from whether they are right, and the difference is not academic: the work
of one authored call was being multiplied by every thread on the machine, so a
decode step's cost came back sixteen thousand times too large and the roofline
called a memory-bound step compute-bound. Nothing failed, because nothing compared
a number to a number.

So this compares numbers. The subject is Qwen3-1.7B because its dimensions are
public and its decoder layer is arithmetic anybody can do on paper: three MLP
matrices, four attention projections, and an attention over a stated context.

The expectations are derived here from the model's own published dimensions, not
copied from a run. That is the point -- a snapshot of today's output would pass
whatever today's output is, which is exactly how the factor above survived. Where
a quantity cannot be derived without knowing an evaluator's per-element
convention, it is bounded rather than asserted: the matmuls are stated exactly,
and the elementwise remainder is held to being small, because a vector of two
thousand elements cannot account for a measurable share of seventy-five million
flops. A wrong count fails the bound in one direction or the other.
