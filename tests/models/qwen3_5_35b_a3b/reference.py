"""The executable semantics one Qwen3.5-35B-A3B decode step is held to.

Inputs and oracle are one pair on purpose. The oracle is a Hugging Face layer
with random weights, so a factory that returned only tensors would leave the
reference free to score them against a differently initialised layer. What each
``*_step`` returns therefore carries both: what the kernels are handed, and the
module it was drawn from.

Weights are not arguments here. Each Module declares them ``ConstTensor``, so a
boundary is run by loading that Module from a ``DictResource`` keyed the way the
Module names its weights and then passing activations alone. Which Hugging Face
tensor a canonical name reads is this model's own fact, stated once in the
``*_constants`` mappings below.

Everything is seeded. The same call returns the same weights and the same
activations, so a disagreement is a disagreement about the compiler rather than
about which random draw each side happened to get.

Two things are deliberate about *how* the oracle is built.

**No Hugging Face cache object is constructed, on either side.** The step's
prior state is assembled as plain tensors, and the oracle's value is taken from a
forward over the whole sequence with the last position kept. Causality is what
makes the second equal a cached one-token step: the last position's output
depends on exactly the context before it. A reference that borrowed Hugging
Face's caching would be checking one cache implementation against another.

**Nothing is built that a boundary does not need.** A published MoE block holds
256 experts and is 3.2 GB in f32; a whole decoder layer is 3.3 GB, and the
published stack is forty of them. So a mixer boundary is given the mixer and its
norm and no MoE block at all, only the layer and MoE boundaries build a layer, and
everything is cached module-scoped so a worker builds each thing once. The
measured reason is in ``hf_layer``. There is no whole-model instantiation
anywhere in this package.

What is *not* covered here is listed in ``test_provenance.py`` rather than left
to be inferred.
