"""Qwen3.5-35B-A3B as corpus cases: what runs, what is analysed, what is
scheduled, and at what context length.

Three Modules, three cases. The published stack is a hybrid -- three linear
attention layers to every full attention one, each ending in the same 256-expert
MoE block -- and the three are different kernels, not one kernel configured three
ways. A `ModelCase` names one Module, so a single case would have to pick one of
them and the other two would be reported as nothing at all.

The boundary each case states is a complete submodule, not the causal LM. That is
the plan's rule for a model this size: the published model is 40 layers of 35
billion parameters, one whole decoder layer is 3.3 GB in f32, and a 40-layer walk
is neither affordable nor more informative than the layer it repeats. What a stack
would observe and these do not -- layer order, the residual thread, the final norm
-- is recorded as untested in `test_provenance.py` rather than approximated.

Two of the three carry a reference. The MoE block does not, for a measured reason
stated at its case; it is compared against Hugging Face in `test_moe.py`.

Two things this deliberately does not state at all:

- **No decoder-layer case.** Each published layer type is its own class holding
  its own mixer, so there are two of them and no single case names the layer.
  Their composition -- the two residuals, and the MoE reading the mixer's output --
  is measured in `test_decoder_layer.py` across both types.
- **No multi-token-prediction case.** `mtp_num_hidden_layers` is 1 and the
  installed transformers implements no head for it, so there is no oracle; a
  reference would be this repository's reading of a config compared against this
  repository's kernels. Measured and stated in `test_provenance.py`.
