"""Qwen3.5-35B-A3B's full-attention decode step against Hugging Face's own.

The kernel carries ``ctx_len`` as a range, and it is run as it is authored: the
loading evaluates the published Function and the range is bound from the cache it
is handed, so what is measured is the kernel the model declares rather than a copy
of it resolved at one length. The corpus runs the same loading.

Weights are declared ``ConstTensor``, so they are bound by the loading and every
call below passes activations alone; those come from ``reference.py``'s drawn step
rather than being assembled here, so a signature change cannot leave one test
agreeing with a stale order.
