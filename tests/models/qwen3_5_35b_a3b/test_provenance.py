"""What this fixture is sourced from, and what it does not cover.

A model package named after a checkpoint makes two claims a reader cannot check
by reading it: that its numbers came from that checkpoint, and that the tests
next to it cover what they appear to. Both are asserted here.

The coverage half is the more important one for a model this size. The published
model is 40 layers and 35 billion parameters, and the reference for it is
declared, boundary-complete submodules rather than a stack -- so what is *not*
executed has to be written down, or "the tests pass" would read as a claim about
the model. ``NOT_EXECUTED`` is that list, and it is checked against the Modules
themselves: a function nobody runs has to be declared here before the suite will
accept it.
