"""The runtime's compile-time refusals, read as diagnostics.

``cuda/static_asserts.cu`` is one translation unit switched by ``-DCASE=n``:
case 0 is the positive control and must compile, every other case violates
exactly one constraint. This driver runs one ``nvcc`` per case and asserts both
the non-zero exit and the expected sentence, so a case that has started failing
for a *different* reason is a failure and not a pass.
