"""Emitter for the ``tir.Sync`` op — emits the mesh-scoped runtime barrier.

The mesh is the whole call. Which barrier runs is ``ops::sync``'s own answer,
read off the ``Mesh`` type's scope, size and base, so the emitted line names who
must agree and never which instruction does it — and a mesh reshaped upstream
cannot leave a stale barrier behind at the call site.

``classify`` still runs here for its refusals: a partial grid sync and a ragged
cross-warp subset are deadlocks, and a ``VerifyError`` before codegen says so
better than the ``static_assert`` that backs it up inside nvcc.
